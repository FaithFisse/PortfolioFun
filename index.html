        <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I am an aspiring web developer based in Cincinnati, Ohio. I am currently looking to make a huge career change that will be more rewarding, challenging, and more exciting than what I do now, and have done in the past.<br>
                I love learning new things, reading, and challenging my brain by completing puzzles and/or tasks. <br>

        <h3>Education</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><em>Milford High School - 2016 to 2020</em></li><br>
                <li><em>University of Cincinnati - Clermont Campus - August 2020 to December 2020</em></li>
                    <p class="notes">*NOTE: I did not finish out my major with this university because COVID-19 had just hit. The major I had decided on was harder to learn online, and I had decided that it was not what I wanted to pursue anymore.
                    I also wanted to take some time away from school and gain some real world experience as well as knowledge.</p>
