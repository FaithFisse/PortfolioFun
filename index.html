        <h3>About Me:</h3>
            <p>I am an aspiring web developer based in Cincinnati, Ohio. I am currently looking to make a huge career change that will be more rewarding, challenging, and more exciting than what I do now, and have done in the past.<br>
                I love learning new things, reading, and challenging my brain by completing puzzles and/or tasks. <br>

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>

            <li><em>Bob Evan's 2019-2021</em></li>
                <p>I was a host providing excellent customer service, carry-out person that put together orders with accuracy, as well as a server for dine-in customers.<br>
                I was versatile and went wherever they needed me at the moment.</p>
            <li><em>Kroger Pharmacy 2021-2022</em></li>

        <h3>Education</h3>
            <ul>

                    <p class="notes">*NOTE: I did not finish out my major with this university because COVID-19 had just hit. The major I had decided on was harder to learn online, and I had decided that it was not what I wanted to pursue anymore.
                    I also wanted to take some time away from school and gain some real world experience while I figured out what I wanted to do for my career.</p><br>
                <li><em>WGU Software Engineering Degree - Coming Soon</em></li>
